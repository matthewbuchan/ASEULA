A party electing arbitration shall initiate it through an established alternative dispute resolution ("ADR") provider mutually agreed upon by the parties. The ADR provider and the parties must comply with the following rules: (a) the arbitration shall be conducted, at the option of the party seeking relief, in person, by telephone, online, or based solely on written submissions; (b) any in person arbitration will take place in the county in which the city or town you have entered as your residence sits (and if neither is applicable, then the arbitration shall take place in San Francisco County, California); (c) either party may bring a claim in small claims court in lieu of arbitration; (d) the ADR provider may award any form of individual relief; (e) UBISOFT will pay all costs for non-frivolous claims; (f) any judgment on the award rendered by the arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction; (g) UBISOFT may not seek reimbursement of its attorney's fees in connection with such arbitration; (h) in the event you receive an arbitration award greater than UBISOFT's last written settlement offer, UBISOFT will pay a ten thousand U.S. Dollar ($10,000.00 USD) minimum recovery and twice the amount of your attorney's fees, (i) claims must be brought in the parties' individual capacity, and not as a plaintiff or class member in any purported class or representative proceeding. You hereby agree that for any dispute or claim that is less than $10,000 USD, you waive any right to a trial (by judge or jury), you waive any right to participate as a member of a class in a class action or similar proceeding, and you will abide by the dispute resolution mechanism in this Section.

10.4.3 For any dispute that is equal to or more than $10,000 and is not resolved or arbitrated under Section 10.4.2 of this EULA, it is hereby agreed that any action at law or in equity arising under this EULA shall be finally adjudicated or determined in any court or courts of the State of California, or of the United States of America, in Los Angeles County, California and the parties hereto hereby submit generally and unconditionally to the personal and exclusive jurisdiction and venue of these courts in respect to any such matter and consent to service of process by any means authorized by California law.

10.4.4 All claims you bring against UBISOFT must be resolved in accordance with this Section 10.
