Any legal suit, action, or proceeding arising out of or related to these Terms or Vernier’s Software shall be instituted exclusively in the federal courts of the United States or the courts of the State of Oregon.

You acknowledge that you may not be able to access all or some of the Site, Software and Content outside of the United States, and that access thereto may not be legal by certain persons or in certain countries. If you choose to access the Site, Software and Content from another location, you do so on your own initiative and are responsible for compliance with applicable local laws.

Class Action Waiver. You hereby waive any right to commence or participate in any class action lawsuit against VERNIER related to any claim, dispute or controversy, and, where applicable, you hereby agree to opt out of any class proceeding against VERNIER otherwise commenced.

Arbitration Agreement. Please read this section carefully. This section affects rights that you may otherwise have. It provides for resolution of most disputes through arbitration instead of court trials and class actions.

Note: This Arbitration Agreement applies only to users in the United States.

YOU AGREE TO GIVE UP ANY RIGHTS TO LITIGATE CLAIMS IN A COURT OR BEFORE A JURY OR TO PARTICIPATE IN A CLASS ACTION OR REPRESENTATIVE ACTION WITH RESPECT TO A CLAIM. OTHER RIGHTS THAT YOU WOULD HAVE IF YOU WENT TO COURT, SUCH AS ACCESS TO DISCOVERY, ALSO MAY BE UNAVAILABLE OR LIMITED IN ARBITRATION.

Any claim or dispute brought by you arising from or relating to these Terms, or to the relationships that result from these Terms, including disputes about the validity, scope or enforceability of this arbitration provision (collectively, “Covered Disputes“) may, at Vernier’s option and in its sole discretion, be settled exclusively by binding, individual arbitration, rather than in court, and to be held in Portland, Oregon, or another location mutually agreeable to the parties. The arbitration will be conducted by the American Arbitration Association under its rules and procedures. The Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this Arbitration Agreement. Prior to initiating any arbitration, you will give Vernier at least 60 days’ advanced written notice of your intent to file for arbitration. You must provide such notice by email to info@vernier.com. During such 60-day notice period, the parties will endeavor to settle amicably by mutual discussions any Covered Disputes. Failing such amicable settlement and expiration of the notice period, either party may initiate arbitration. The arbitrator will have the power to grant whatever relief would be available in court under law or in equity, and any award of the arbitrator(s) will be final and binding on each of the parties. Judgment upon the award rendered by an arbitrator may be entered in any court of competent jurisdiction. The arbitrator will apply applicable law and the provisions of these Terms, and the failure to do so will be deemed an excess of arbitral authority and grounds for judicial review. You are not entitled to arbitrate any Covered Dispute as a class, representative or private attorney action, and the arbitrator(s) will have no authority to proceed on a class, representative or private attorney general basis. If any provision of the agreement to arbitrate in this section is found illegal or unenforceable, the remaining arbitration terms shall continue to be fully valid, binding, and enforceable (but in no case will there be a class, representative or private attorney general arbitration). These Terms and related transactions will be subject to and governed by the Federal Arbitration Act, 9 U.S.C. sec. 1-16 (FAA) and, where otherwise applicable, by the laws of the State of Oregon. Vernier reserves all rights to pursue any and all claims and remedies, whether in a court of law or other tribunal, and in no way shall the foregoing be interpreted to limit Vernier’s rights in this regard.

Modification of Terms of Use. We are constantly trying to improve our Site, Software and Content, so these Terms may need to change along with the Site. We reserve the right to modify these Terms at any time by updating this posting without notice. All changes are effective immediately when posted and apply to all access to and use of the Site. If you use the Site, Software and Content in any way after a change to the Terms is effective, that means you agree to all of the changes.

Entire Agreement. This Agreement constitutes the entire agreement between the parties with respect to the subject matter hereof. If any provision of this Agreement is held by a court of competent jurisdiction to be contrary to law, the provision shall be modified by the court and interpreted so as to best accomplish the objectives of the original provision to the fullest extent permitted by law, and the remaining provisions of this Agreement shall remain in effect.

Waiver. Vernier’s failure to enforce any provision of these Terms will not be deemed a waiver of that provision or any other provision of these Terms.

Severability. If any provision of these Terms are held invalid or unenforceable under applicable law, that portion shall be construed in a manner consistent with applicable law to accomplish, as nearly as possible, the objective thereof, or shall be severed from the document if, and solely, to the limited extent such construction is not possible, and the remaining portion of these Terms shall remain in full force and effect.

Relationship of the Parties. No joint venture, partnership, employment, or agency relationship exists between you and Vernier as a result of these Terms or your use of Vernier’s Site, Software or Content.
