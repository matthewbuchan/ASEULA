TITLE, DELIVERY AND RISK OF LOSS.
3.1. Transfer Terms. Delivery is made available Ex Works (Incoterms 2010) at Stratasys' designated facility, unless agreed otherwise by the parties in the respective order, with respect to shipping costs, risk of loss and title transfer, except that regardless of the delivery method title transfer shall ever occur for any licensed Software associated with any Product sale. Notwithstanding delivery and the passage of risk and whether or not credit is extended for any Product purchase, the following shall apply:
3.1.1. If the applicable law (as determined according to Section 16 (Jurisdiction) below) so permits, property in and title to Products shall remain with Stratasys, and shall not pass to Customer, until Stratasys has received payment of the full price and license fees (if applicable) for (a) all Products, Software and/or Services that are the subject of these Terms, and (b) all other goods and/or services supplied by Stratasys to Customer under any contract whatsoever. Payment of the full price and license fees shall include without limitation, the amount of any interest or other sum payable under the terms of this and all other contracts between Stratasys and Customer. Moreover, Customer shall keep the Products identified as retained until such retention lapses.
3.1.2. If the applicable law does not permit the arrangement described in Section 3.1.1 above, Stratasys hereby reserves in the Products (as well as all proceeds resulting from any sale thereof), and Customer grants and agrees that the Products shall remain fully subject to, a first priority purchase money security interest, until Stratasys has received payment of the full price and license fees (if applicable) for all the items listed in paragraphs (a) and (b) of Section 3.1.1. Payment of the full price and license fees shall include without limitation, the amount of any interest or other sum payable under the terms of this and all other contracts between Stratasys and Customer. Moreover, Customer hereby covenants that
no hindrance to its granting of the above security interest exists in any of its third party contracts; or
in the event such a hindrance does exist, Customer shall assist Stratasys in exercising, and shall take all actions necessary to protect and maintain such security interest.
3.2. Delivery. Stratasys will attempt to cooperate with Customer's requested delivery dates or other related delivery requests, but cannot and does not warrant quoted shipment or delivery dates or time frames, and may fulfill ordered items by partial and incremental shipments, in its sole discretion. Customer acknowledges and agrees that all costs and obligations associated with shipment and delivery of Products shall be borne solely by Customer; that any insurance desired therefore shall be Customer's sole obligation and expense; and that in no event shall Stratasys be liable for any direct or indirect damage or loss that the Customer may incur resulting from any delivery failure or delay. Customer will notify Stratasys in writing within ten (10) calendar days following the date of delivery of any alleged Product defect or other Purchase Order discrepancies, and the Products and licensed Software shall be deemed to be accepted in the quantity specified on the bill of lading or commercial invoice and in good condition, and such acceptance will operate as a bar to claims against Stratasys, if no such notice is received.
INSTALLATION.
Products that do not require installation by Stratasys may be installed by Customer and used at any time following delivery. Stratasys (or its authorized technical representative) will install those Products (including Software) or Parts designated as requiring installation by Stratasys or its authorized technical representative (such Products or Parts, "Stratasys Installed Products/Parts"), at Customer's designated facility following receipt of all applicable payments related thereto. Prior to such installation, Customer, at its expense, shall complete all applicable Product site preparations for installation, as specified by applicable Product documentation and as required by applicable law, including, without limitation, all health and safety laws, and shall thereafter provide such other assistance, services and facilities as may be requested by Stratasys (or its authorized technical representative) to complete such installation. Stratasys Installed Products/Parts shall not be handled, operated, opened, dismantled or used at any time prior to completion of required installation thereof, and then, initially in the presence and under the supervision of authorized Stratasys technical personnel. Where applicable and required by Stratasys, Stratasys (or its authorized technical representative) will perform a standard test of the Products and present a certificate of installation ("COI") upon completion of the required installation.
TRAINING.
During any Product installation required to be performed by Stratasys (or its authorized technical representative), and in consideration for Customer's payment of charges due (unless otherwise specified in the Purchase Order acceptance), Stratasys shall make available to qualified personnel of Customer basic training in the use and operation of the Products according to the applicable Product documentation.

Upon termination for any reason, Customer shall immediately cease use of any Software not embedded within the Systems, delete or destroy all copies in its possession, including that which may have been provided to contractors or consultants, and execute and deliver to Stratasys a certification evidencing same. The unenforceability of any provision of these Terms adjudged by any court of competent jurisdiction shall in no way affect the enforceability of any other provision hereof, which shall remain in full force and effect. Any failure by either party to exercise any right or remedy under the Terms does not constitute a waiver, or signify acceptance, of the event giving rise to such right or remedy. Any waiver or other alleged modification or amendment by Stratasys of any provision of these Terms must be in writing and signed by an authorized officer of Stratasys to be valid. Provisions which by their nature should survive termination of the parties' business relationship and any agreements between or among them, including, but not limited to, Sections 1.4 (Restrictions on Use), 2 (Payment and Taxes), 3.1 (Transfer Terms), 6.3 (Exclusion of Warranties), 6.4 (Warranty Disclaimer), 7 (Limitation of Liability), 8 (Proprietary Rights), 9 (Confidentiality), and 12 (Export Compliance) through 17 (General) shall so survive indefinitely. To the extent that these Terms are accepted electronically, Customer hereby waives any applicable rights to require an original (non-electronic) signature or delivery or retention of non-electronic records, to the extent not prohibited under applicable law. Additionally, Stratasys may request modifications to Customer’s purchase orders as it relates to shipping terms, risk of loss and/or payment terms without affecting or negating the enforceability of the remaining provisions set forth herein.
