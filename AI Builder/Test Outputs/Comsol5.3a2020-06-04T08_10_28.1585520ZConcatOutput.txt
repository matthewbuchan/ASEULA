The license granted herein is contingent upon your timely and complete payment of all amounts due and payable to us. h Use. (i) If you have licensed the NSL version of the Programs, they may be installed and operated on up to four (4) individually designated physical computers, provided the Programs are only accessible to, and operated by, a single licensed user designated by us as the "Named User" for that license and provided that the Named User may concurrently use the Programs on only two (2) of those computers at any given time. Any further installation of the Programs on another computer shall be conditioned upon proof to our satisfaction that the Programs UT were uninstalled from a computer on which the Programs were previously installed, provided, however, that the Programs may not be transferred to more than two (2) computers in any year. You may replace the Named User for the license, on a temporary or permanent basis but no more than two (2) times a year, provided that only one licensed user is designated to us as the Named User at any given time. The NSL version of the Programs may not be accessed or used over a network or remotely. (ii) If you have licensed the CPU version of the Programs, they may be installed and operated on a single designated physical computer, provided the Programs are only accessible to, and operated by, a single licensed user at a time. You may replace the designated computer for the license, on a temporary or permanent basis but no more than two (2) times a year, provided that only one computer is designated to us at any given time. Any transfer of the Programs from one computer to another shall be conditioned upon proof to our satisfaction that the Programs were uninstalled from the first computer, provided, however, that the Programs may not be transferred to more than two (2) computers in any year. The CPU version of the Programs may not be accessed or used over a network or remotely. (ii) If you have licensed the FNL version of the Programs, they may be installed in a central location on a single dedicated network server or on the server of a third party providing secure remote computing capacity through which the Programs are made accessible for your use. You may have as many individuals using the Programs at any given time as the number of concurrent users for which you have purchased FNL licenses for such Programs. If the Programs have the ability to run as client and server on separate computers, the FNL version (and not the NSL or CPU versions) gives you the right to use the Programs as client and server on separate computers. If the Programs have the ability to perform cluster computing, the FNL version (and not the NSL or CPU versions) gives you the right to have the Programs perform cluster computing. With respect to network installation, the Programs may also be installed on individual computers, as long as the individual installations are controlled by the license manager on the network server. Any transfer of the license manager for the Programs from one computer to another shall be conditioned upon proof to our satisfaction that the license manager was uninstalled from the first computer. You may not provide access to the FNL version of the Programs to users located outside the territory in which the license manager server is installed unless you have contracted for wider use, except with respect to installation on the server of a source of secure remote computing capacity, in which case access to the Programs must be restricted to the territory in which you reside, as set forth in subparagraph (ix) of this Section 1(h) below. (iv) If you have licensed the CSL version of the Programs, they may be installed on an individual computer or in a central location on a single dedicated network server or on the server of a third party providing secure remote computing capacity through which the Programs are made accessible for use permitted under this Agreement. Log-in credentials may not be shared among authorized users of the CSL version of the Programs. In no event may you use the CSL version of the Programs to run more than 4 Licensee Applications at any given time for each licensed concurrent user. You may use the CSL version of the 6 Programs to perform cluster computing. With respect to a network installation, the Programs may also be installed on individual computers, as long as the individual installations are controlled by the license manager on the network server. Any transfer of the license manager for the Programs from one computer to another shall be conditioned upon proof to our satisfaction that the license manager was uninstalled from the first computer. The CSL version of the Programs may be installed, accessed, and used worldwide, subject to the terms and conditions of this Agreement, including, without limitation, compliance with the restrictions set forth in Section 4, but you must reside in the same territory in which the CSL license was sold. The CSL license permits you to use the Programs for the sole purpose of hosting and running Licensee Applications. Your use of Licensee Applications must comply with all restrictions on Licensee Applications set forth in the Licensee Application Addendum and with any terms and conditions specified by the publisher of each Licensee Application. The CSL also allows you to distribute the client software licensed under the CCL to authorized users of your CSL installation for use under this Agreement. (v) The CCL may be used to connect to an authorized CSL installation. The client software licensed under the CCL must be obtained from a source authorized by us. The client software licensed under the CCL may be either installed on an individual computer or accessed from a CSL installation (licensed by you or another party or provided by us) through a web browser. The CCL gives you the right to run Licensee Applications that are hosted by a CSL installation. Your use of Licensee Applications must comply with all restrictions on Licensee Applications set forth in the Licensee Application Addendum and with any terms and conditions specified by the publisher of each Licensee Application. The CCL also allows you to upload Licensee Applications to a CSL installation and perform administrative tasks where you have been granted privileges to do so by the licensee of the CSL installation. (vi) If the NSL, CPU, and/ or FNL versions of the Programs or the class kit option license ("CKL") or academic server license ("ASL") version has been licensed by an Institution at Academic Prices (as such terms are defined in the Academic Addendum to this Agreement), your use of such Programs will be subject to the additional Terms and Conditions in the applicable Addendum to this Agreement. (vii) With respect to any of the foregoing licenses, you may use the Programs on multicore/multiprocessor computers. (viii) You may make a backup copy of the Programs and Documentation as reasonably necessary to support the use of the Programs in accordance with this Agreement. (ix) Except with respect to the CSL and ASL version of the Programs, you may use the Programs only for your internal operations within the territory for which we have issued the license, unless otherwise consented to by us in writing. Unless you have contracted for a broader territory as reflected in our invoice or our order acknowledgment, each country shall be a territory, except that all servers within North Atlantic Free Trade Agreement ("NAFTA") member countries shall be considered to be within the same territory. For the purposes of this Agreement, "internal operations" means use of the Programs by your employees and on-site 7 independent contractors or those of your subsidiaries or parent company and for the performance of consulting or research for third parties who engage you as an employee or independent contractor. For purposes of this paragraph, independent contractors who are remotely accessing an on-site installation of the Programs, to the extent remote access is permitted for the applicable license type, shall be deemed to be using the Programs on-site. Notwithstanding the foregoing, use of the Programs by your independent contractors shall be deemed part of your "internal operations" only when the Programs are used exclusively for your operations. (x) The fees for the license granted herein are determined based upon your installation and use of the Programs in the territory for which we have issued the license. We may charge you an additional fee for any installation or use of the Programs in any other territory. (xi) As used herein, "uninstalled" means completely removing the Programs from a computer on which they were installed or otherwise rendering such Programs inaccessible such as by destroying a hard drive on which Programs were installed or recycling a hard drive on which Programs were installed. i No Reverse Engineering. You shall not decompile, reverse engineer, disassemble, isolate, separate, or otherwise attempt to derive source code from any Program(s) or Documentation, except and only to the extent that such activity is expressly permitted by applicable law notwithstanding this limitation. All copies of Programs and Documentation shall contain all copyright and proprietary notices as in the original. You shall not remove, obscure, or alter copyright notices, trademark notices, or other proprietary rights notices affixed to or contained within the licensed Programs or Documentation. Notwithstanding anything else set forth in these Terms and Conditions to the contrary, you may reverse engineer, disassemble, isolate, separate, and modify only those files specifically listed in the offer.txt file that is included with the Programs, or listed under your licensed version of the Programs on www.comsol.com/legal/offer/, as eligible for such activities. Upon request as set forth herein, for a period of three years following your acceptance of these Terms and Conditions, we will provide you with the source or object code needed to recreate any or all of only those files specifically listed in the offer.txt file that is included with the Programs, or listed under your licensed version of the Programs on www.comsol.com/legal/offer/, as eligible for such activities. All requests pursuant to this Paragraph shall be made in writing and addressed by first class mail to the address set forth in the offer.txt file. We may charge a fee for sending you the code to cover our cost of distribution. If you are a licensee in the European Union: You may decompile, disassemble or otherwise reverse engineer the Programs only where any such act is necessary to create an independent program which is interoperable with the Programs or with another program or to observe, study, or test the functioning of the Programs solely to understand the ideas and 8 principles which underlie any element of the Programs ("Permitted Objective") and provided that: (i) the information necessary to achieve the Permitted Objective has not already been made available or has not been provided by us within a reasonable time after a written request to provide such information; (ii) the compilation, disassembly, reverse-engineering, etc., is confined to those parts of the Programs necessary to achieve the Permitted Objective; (iii) the information gained is not used for anything other than the Permitted Objective and is not disclosed to any other person except as may be necessary to achieve the Permitted Objective; and (iv) the information obtained is not used to create a program(s) substantially similar in its expression to any Program(s), including, but not limited to, expressions of the Programs in other computer languages, or for any other act restricted by copyright in the Programs. j Authentication and Validation. We may use various technologies to authenticate and validate your use of the Programs and to process related information in our information systems. k U.S. Government. If you are acquiring this license to the Programs on behalf of any unit or agency of the U.S. Government, the Government shall only have the rights for this Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation as set forth herein in accordance with the applicable Federal Acquisition Regulations for the acquisition of Commercial Computer Software and Commercial Computer Software Documentation. In particular, for units of the Department of Defense: the Government shall have only the rights specified in the license under which the Programs, as commercial computer software, and the Documentation, as commercial computer software documentation, were obtained, as set forth in subparagraph (a) of the Rights in Commercial Computer Software or Commercial Software Documentation Clause at DFARS 227.7202-3, therefore the rights set forth herein shall apply. For any other Government unit or agency: The Government shall have only the rights specified in this Agreement under which the Programs as commercial computer software and the Documentation as commercial computer software documentation were obtained, as set forth in FAR 12.212. When FAR clause 52.227-19 applies, the Government's rights include those set forth in paragraph (b)(2) of that clause, except that under no condition does this license extend to the source code of the Programs or otherwise obligate us to modify the Programs or Documentation for the Government. Where the Programs as commercial computer software and the Documentation as commercial computer software documentation are licensed to the Government under a contract that includes FAR clause 52.227-19 or similar, the following Notice is incorporated herein: NOTICE-Notwithstanding this license agreement that may pertain to, or accompany the delivery of, this computer software (the Programs) and computer software documentation (the Documentation), the rights of the government regarding its use, reproduction, and disclosure are as set forth in clause 9 52.227-19(b)(2) of the Government Contract under which it was acquired. If you wish to send us "covered defense information", as such term is defined in DFAR clause 252.204-7012, or other U.S. governmental information that is restricted by law, you shall do so solely by email to: support@us.comsol.com. If you are acquiring this license pursuant to work you are doing under a U.S. government contract, you agree that you will provide the government with the necessary disclosures, notices, and restricted rights legends, and take any other necessary steps, to ensure that the rights granted with respect to the Programs are no broader than as set forth herein. I Trial Licenses. If you have been granted a license to a trial version of any Program, i.e., to test the Program without any payment obligation, you may not use the Program for any commercial or production use, i.e., you may use the Program only to test the functionality of the Program. Trial licenses shall be for the license type we specify and shall last for the length of time specified by us, in our sole discretion, and may be cancelled at any time by us, in our sole discretion. In the event we do not specify a license type for a trial license, the trial license shall be deemed to be for the NSL license type for the use of the Named User to whom we have issued such trial license. Upon expiration of the trial period, all Programs that are the subject of that trial license shall automatically become disabled. Support shall be provided only for the length of time that the trial license is in effect, and there shall be no other maintenance services provided in connection with any trial licenses. We shall have no warranty obligations for trial licenses of any type. With respect to trial licenses, this paragraph (1) shall prevail over any conflicting provisions in this Agreement. m Protection and Confidentiality of Our Information. You acknowledge that the Programs contain trade secrets and other valuable and confidential information of ours and of licensors of information or materials to us, and you shall not act, or fail to act, in any way or manner to intentionally or negligently harm our or our licensors' rights in our or their respective intellectual property in the Programs and Documentation. The Programs, together with any other information learned in connection therewith that should reasonably be considered confidential under the circumstances, are "Confidential Information". You shall disclose Confidential Information of ours and our licensors only on a need-to-know basis to your employees; you may not disclose any Confidential Information of ours and our licensors to a third party; and you shall use all reasonable care to keep the Confidential Information of ours and our licensors confidential consistent with the grant of your licensed rights. In no event shall the obligations set forth in this Section 1(m) override any requirement imposed on any licensee using the Programs by or on behalf of any state or federal government within the U.S. by any public records, freedom of information, or similar law providing for public access to governmental records. n Protection and Confidentiality of Your Information. If you wish to supply proprietary information for the purpose of obtaining maintenance and support pursuant to Paragraph 5 of this Agreement, you may do so by conspicuously 10 marking any such information as "Confidential" and submitting such information solely through the web page: https://secure.comsol.com/support/confidential. All proprietary information marked and transmitted in the foregoing manner which derives actual or potential economic value from being kept confidential shall be considered "Confidential Information". For a period of three years following your disclosure of Confidential Information to us: we will disclose such Confidential Information only on a need-to-know basis to our employees and contractors and not to any other person or entity; we shall use such Confidential Information solely for the purposes for which it is disclosed; and we shall use all reasonable care to keep such Confidential Information confidential consistent with your disclosure of such information to us. o Exceptions to Confidentiality. The confidentiality obligation set forth in Section 1(n) shall not apply to any information or materials which (i) were in our possession before we received them from you; (ii) are or become publicly available through no fault of ours; (iii) are independently developed without reliance on the Confidential Information; (iv) are received from a third party with no duty of confidentiality to you; (v) are approved by you in writing for disclosure, or (vi) are made available by you to a third party without any restriction on disclosure. Furthermore, neither the obligations set forth in Section 1(n) nor our receipt of your Confidential Information shall be construed to limit us from independently developing or acquiring products or technologies without the use of your Confidential Information, nor to work with persons or entities that have independently developed information or materials similar to such Confidential Information. You acknowledge that we may be actively engaged in technical development related to the subject matter of your Confidential Information. You covenant not to sue or bring any action, claim, or proceeding against us, our subsidiaries or affiliates, or any of our or their officers, directors, employees, or contractors, based in whole or in part on the use, copying, or other exploitation of any Residuals. "Residuals" means any and all Confidential Information in intangible form that may be retained in the unaided memory of a person having had access to that information, including ideas, concepts, know-how, or techniques that are not recognizable or traceable to a party. We shall have no obligation to limit or restrict the assignment of such persons or to pay royalties for the use of Residuals. p Legal Proceedings/Government Investigations. We may provide any and all information provided to us to any party in response to a subpoena or to a judicial or administrative order requiring the production of such information or to any governmental authority in connection with the investigation and/ or prosecution of any actual or potential crime. Notwithstanding the foregoing, we will undertake commercially reasonable measures to ensure that any production of your Confidential Information pursuant to this Section 1(p) is done in a manner that ensures the confidentiality of such Confidential Information shall be protected and will undertake commercially reasonable measures to give you 1 1 notice reasonably in advance of any production of your Confidential Information in response to a subpoena or judicial or administrative order. q Submissions. To the extent you suggest any improvements to the Programs or suggest any new product or service offerings, including ideas, concepts, proposals, or other materials in connection therewith (collectively, "Submissions"): (i) you represent and warrant that, to the best of your knowledge, such Submissions do not infringe any intellectual property rights of any third party; (ii) you acknowledge that we may use such Submissions but are under no obligation to do so; (iii) you grant to us a non-exclusive, irrevocable, world-wide license to reproduce, distribute, transmit, publicly display, publicly perform, modify, translate, make derivative works based on, manufacture, make, market, sell, offer to sell and/ or otherwise use such Submissions and derivative works based thereon, in whole or in part, including, without limitation, by incorporating such Submissions, in whole or in part, within our Programs and/ or other programs, and occurring in or through any media now existing or existing at any time in the future, and to grant sublicenses to engage in the foregoing activities; (iv) you waive any right or claim to additional consideration for such Submissions beyond our review of your Submissions and the rights you receive under the Terms and Conditions (including any claim for payment or other compensation); and (v) you waive any right or claim to attribution in connection with any use we may make of such Submissions. To the extent we are not independently developing ideas, concepts, proposals, or other materials similar to the Submission(s), we may contact you regarding any Submissions for which we may want to consider seeking patent rights. r Future Releases. We reserve the right to change or discontinue any or all of the Programs without prior notice, although any such change in, or discontinuance of, a Program shall not abrogate your right to continue using a previously licensed Program for the duration of the term. 2 License Term. Unless terminated earlier according to the Terms and Conditions, this Agreement shall continue annually, for a term, or perpetually, as identified in the purchase order accepted by us or our invoice. Absent any such earlier termination, term licenses will end after their term, unless the then-current term license fee has been previously remitted to us. You shall have the right to use Programs licensed under a perpetual license indefinitely, subject to the termination as well as maintenance and support provisions of this Agreement. 3 Delivery. We may deliver the Programs and Documentation to you in archival form on physical computer readable media or over the Internet with installation materials which specify the licensed Programs. You shall be responsible for all use of your installation materials, authorized or not, and you shall not disclose the archive installation materials or allow them to be used except for use as expressly permitted herein. Compliance with Export Laws. The Programs are subject to U.S. and United Kingdom export control laws or other (U.S., U.K., and non-U.S.) governmental export and import laws and regulations ("Export Laws"). Notwithstanding any other term of this Agreement or any other agreement, neither you nor any third party may exercise any of your rights under this Agreement in violation of any Export Law, nor may this Agreement be transferred to any party where doing so 12 would result in such a violation. The terms of any limitation on the use, transfer or re-export of the Programs imposed by us in any document for the purpose of export control shall prevail over any of the Terms and Conditions in this Agreement, but it shall be your responsibility to comply with the latest Export Law. You represent and warrant that neither you nor any person or entity you permit to use the Programs under this Agreement is located in or is a permanent resident of any country subject to any U.S. or other embargo or any country that is specially designated by the U.S. government as a "terrorist supporting" country and that neither you nor any person or entity you permit to use the Programs under this Agreement is on any U.S. government list of prohibited or restricted parties. If, in connection with any support request, you wish to send us information that can only be shared with U.S. persons under any Export Laws, the only way in which you may do so is by email to: support@us.comsol.com. You understand and agree that restricting any support request in this manner will limit the number of support engineers available to respond to your request, which may limit our ability to provide a response that is to your satisfaction. In the event that you wish to include any Confidential Information in such a support request to be protected in accordance with Section 1(n), you must mark such email with the designation "Confidential Information" in the subject line of the message. You shall be solely responsible for ensuring that all files you send to us in connection with any support request comply with all applicable Export Laws, including with respect to our accessing those files in any locations in which we do business and by our employees, regardless of nationality or residency, unless such requests are submitted as set forth in this Section 4. In the event you are unable to provide us with items relevant to a support request on account of Export Laws, we shall undertake commercially reasonable efforts to address the support request but do not guarantee our ability to do so. 5 Maintenance and Support. Unless you have purchased a term license with a maintenance period expiring prior to the end of the term, software maintenance service will terminate upon the earlier of twelve (12) months or the expiration of the term. Notwithstanding the foregoing, termination of the maintenance period for any one Program shall terminate the maintenance period for all other Programs that require that Program in order to run, even if such other Programs were purchased separately. That initial software maintenance period commences on the first day of the month following the month in which a purchase order has been accepted. However, if, by that time, you have not yet supplied us with all of the information needed for us to provide installation materials, the initial software maintenance period shall commence on the first day of the month following the month during which we first requested the information needed to provide installation materials. Notwithstanding the foregoing, there shall be no reduction in the initial software maintenance period on account of any delay by us in requesting the information necessary to provide installation materials or any delay by us in providing installation materials following receipt by us of all such information. Maintenance includes: (a) commercially reasonable efforts to provide support by telephone, telefax, or electronic mail regarding the installation and/or use of the licensed Programs and their interaction with hardware, operating environments, and other software products except as set forth below, including the provision of installation materials; (b) subsequent releases of the Programs free of charge; (c) issuance of replacement license files to enable changes in use of the Programs, including changes in hardware 13 running the Programs, to the extent permitted by the applicable license type; and (d) reasonable commercial efforts to provide (i) workarounds within a reasonable time for any material programming errors in the current release of the Programs which are directly attributable to us, and (ii) correction of such errors in the next available release, provided you provide us with sufficient information to identify such errors and to ensure their elimination from future releases.
